# JPG to PNG Converter

This Python program converts JPG images in one directory and saves them as PNG images in another directory.

Library used: [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Pillow installation:

```bash
    pip3 install Pillow
```

To run, specify the directory with JPG images as the first argument, then the name of the new directory with PNG images as the second argument.

My example:

```bash
    python3 JPGtoPNGConverter.py images converted-images
```
